//Floyd's Cycle-Finding Algorithm Steps:
//1. Initialize slow and fast pointers to the head of the linked list.
//2. Move the slow pointer by one and the fast pointer by two. If they meet at some point, then there is a loop.
//3. If they donâ€™t meet and the fast pointer reaches the end, then there is no loop.
